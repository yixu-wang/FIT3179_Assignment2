          Shifting attitudes towards alcohol consumption in Australia
        </div>
        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div class="paragraphcentre">
          Alcohol holds an undeniable place in Australian culture. Consumed by roughly three-quarters of Australians
          14 years and above [1], alcoholic beverages are arguably some of Australians' favourite drinks. Yet our love
          of alcohol also makes us particularly susceptible to the harms that stem from the abuse of this euphoric
          substance.
          To address this, numerous strategies, such as the government's National Drug Strategy [3],
          have been developed in part to reduce the risky consumption of alcohol. But just how successful have these
          policies been?

        </div>

        <!-- Map Section-->
        <div class="sectionhead">Alcohol Consumption By Region</div>
        <div class="paragraphleft">
          Interact with the map above to see the geographic distribution of risky consumers of alcohol (more than
          4 standard drinks a day or 10 standard drinks a week), as defined by the National Health and Medical Research
          Council (NHMRC) guidelines.

          A quick glance at the data through time shows that rural populations are generally riskier drinkers, with the
          outback regions in Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory consistently remaining
          hotspots throughout the recorded period.
          Several potential reasons have been proposed, including the strong drinking culture in remote communities,
          the lack of entertainment options, and limited access to health services [3].
          <br><br>
          Conversely, the map also suggests that heavy consumption is falling in the cities, particularly in Victoria,
          New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.
          Whether this is due to effective messaging is impossible to determine from the visualised data. However, the
          data does suggest a need for
          a different approach towards rural populations - one that addresses the issues mentioned above.

          We can also divide the population based on their drinking behaviours and
          analyse the characteristics of each subpopulation. Of particular interest are the younger age groups
          (14-17 and 18-24), who are more vulnerable to alcohol misuse due to social pressure and curiosity,
          while also most susceptible to the harms of alcohol due to their developing brains [4].
          <br><br>
          While adolescents (14-17) in general are extremely unlikely to participate in risky drinking, young adults
          of both genders (18-24) are the heaviest drinkers of all age groups, albeit by a small margin for men.
          These statistics reinforce the idea that messaging should be primarily targeted towards young people,
          especially when considering their status as a vulnerable population.
          <br><br>
          Perhaps unsurprisingly, men are more likely across the board to drink heavily than women; suggested reasons
          for this include genetics, marketing, and peer pressure [5].

          Perhaps the most interesting of all is how risky alcohol consumption has changed over the past
          two decades. Almost all age groups are now consuming less alcohol when compared to 2002 statistics,
          with 60-69 year olds being the only exception. <br><br>
          We can also see that underage drinking is actually on the decline, and is part of a decades-long trend which
          has seen the proportion of risky teenage drinkers go from 30.7% to just 5.5%.
          <br><br>
          A similar trend can be observed in young adults, although not to the same extent. The proportion of such
          drinkers
          has also appeared to have stabilised at around 41% since 2016.
          <br><br>
          In fact, these patterns reflect a "global shift", according to the Unviersity of New South Wales [6], which
          affirms
          that the phenomenon is not due to increased consumption of illicit drugs. Does that imply, then, that in the
          near
          future, young people will be completely healthy free of any drugs?

          Unfortunately, things are unlikely to be that simple. For one, young adult alcohol use is stagnant, rather
          than decreasing, and remains the highest among all age groups. In addition, however, a new product has also
          begun to
          gain popularity in recent years: e-cigarettes, or "vapes".
          <br><br>
          These cigarette replacements often contain nicotine and artificial flavourings, and are perceived by
          those who use them to be less harmful than cigarettes - on par with "drinking alcohol, eating junk food, and
          using cannabis" [7].
          However, while research on the harms of vaping is limited, growing evidence several potential harms,
          such as lung damage, increased risk of cancer, and nicotine addiction [8].
          <br><br>
          Despite this, e-cigarettes have proven to be especially popular with young adults, with the proportion of
          users growing from just 2.8% to 20.6% in just 6 years. This may indicate the emergence of an alarming new
          trend, which requires
          new messaging to combat effectively.
          <br><br>
          It may be reassuring that strategies against vaping have already begun to take shape, with a new national
          campaign
          targeting young people launched in June of this year [9]. Of course, their effectiveness is yet to be proven.

          Summary
        </div>
        <div class="paragraphleft">
          Overall, while the effectivessness of the government's
          messaging on alcohol use cannot be evaluated directly, it also cannot be denied that alcohol use
          is essentially at an all time low for many age groups, especially teenagers.
          <br><br>
          Of course, more can always be done,
          and rural populations and young adults have shown relatively resistant to this trend in recent years, likely
          due to the
          likely due to the unique and distinct pressures faced by these two groups. This indicates the need for more
          refined messaging and strategies which address the root cause of the groups' alcohol usage.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, it appears that
          young adults are increasingly turning away from alcohol towards vaping; this necessitates its own messaging,
          and only time will tell whether
          similar results can be achieved.
