          Shifting attitudes towards alcohol consumption in Australia
        </div>
        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div class="paragraphcentre">
          Alcohol holds an undeniable place in Australian culture. Consumed by roughly three-quarters of Australians
          14 years and above [1], alcoholic beverages are arguably some of Australians' favourite drinks. Yet our love
          of alcohol also makes us particularly susceptible to the harms that stem from the abuse of this euphoric
          substance.
          To address this, numerous strategies, such as the government's National Drug Strategy [3],
          have been developed in part to reduce the risky consumption of alcohol. But just how successful have these
          policies been?

        </div>

        <!-- Map Section-->
        <div class="sectionhead">Alcohol Consumption By Region</div>
        <div class="paragraphleft">
          Interact with the map above to see the geographic distribution of risky consumers of alcohol (more than 
          4 standard drinks a day or 10 standard drinks a week), as defined by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines.

              // Access the Vega view instance (https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/) as result.view
            }).catch(console.error);

          A quick glance at the data through time shows that rural populations are generally riskier drinkers, with the 
          outback regions in Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory consistently remaining hotspots throughout the recorded period. 
          Several potential reasons have been proposed, including the strong drinking culture in remote communities, 
          the lack of entertainment options, and limited access to health services [3]. 
          <br><br>
          Conversely, the map also suggests that heavy consumption is falling in the cities, particularly in Victoria, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. 
          Whether this is due to effective messaging is impossible to determine from the visualised data. However, the data does suggest a need for 
          a different approach towards rural populations - one that addresses the issues mentioned above.

          We can also divide the population based on their drinking behaviours and 
          analyse the characteristics of each subpopulation. Of particular interest are the younger age groups
          (14-17 and 18-24), who are more vulnerable to alcohol misuse due to social pressure and curiosity, 
          while also most susceptible to the harms of alcohol due to their developing brains [4]. 
          <br><br>
          While adolescents (14-17) in general are extremely unlikely to participate in risky drinking, young adults
          of both genders (18-24) are the heaviest drinkers of all age groups, albeit by a small margin for men. 
          These statistics reinforce the idea that messaging should be primarily targeted towards young people, 
          especially when considering their status as a vulnerable population. 
          <br><br>
          Perhaps unsurprisingly, men are more likely across the board to drink heavily than women; suggested reasons 
          for this include genetics, marketing, and peer pressure [5].
